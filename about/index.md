Hi, my name is Fabrizio Bellicano. Currently pursuing some personal projects, I hold a Master of Science in Computer Science (Interactive Entertainment Technology) from Trinity College, Dublin, and a Bachelor of Engineering from the University of Genova, Italy.

I worked for IBM for a period before having to quit for personal reasons. Till now I have been expanding my knowledge about current cool technologies, like Node.js and its use with Mongo and Redis. I am also a DevOps wannabe, so I explored Docker/Puppet and the likes, as well as taking care of my own personal server.

Have a look at my [short resume here](../resume/). If you want more verbosity and less easy-to-read, check my [skillset](../skillset/): I also have reviews of my [objectives](../skillset/2016-end) there.

You can reach me at {{ site.data.theme.email }} -- Alternatively, I also still check bellicaf @at@ tcd dot ie.
