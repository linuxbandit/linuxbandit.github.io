Hi, my name is Fabrizio Bellicano. Currently pursuing some personal projects, I hold a Master of Science in Computer Science (Interactive Entertainment Technology) from Trinity College, Dublin, and a Bachelor of Engineering from the University of Genova, Italy.

I worked for IBM for a period before having to quit for personal reasons. Till now I have been expanding my knowledge about OpenCV, OpenGL, and OpenCL, both on PC and on mobile.

Have a look at my [short resume here](../resume/)

You can reach me at {{site.theme.email}} -- Alternatively, I also still check bellicaf at tcd dot ie.
