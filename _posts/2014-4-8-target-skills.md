Last December/January, when I was so excited about finding out this [lagom theme](https://github.com/swanson/lagom), and this awesome way of creating websites (although I still prefer bare HTML) was getting unvealed to my eyes, I thought also to include a web version of my résumé, and I found [this](https://github.com/chmduquesne/resume).

Because of this awesomeness/ease of creating websites I realised I would put many versions of my [CV online](/resume), that each year I would write what I want to achieve in terms of skills for the next year. 

So there we go for [beginning](/resume/2014-beg) and [end of 2014](/resume/2014-end) (focused only on skills, languages and certifications). Better late than never, I've been busy since January as you may have read.
