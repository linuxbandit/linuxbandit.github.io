[Here's](/resume/2015-beg) a current version of my skill set as of Jan 2015. Compared to the [goals I had set](/resume/2014-end), it's not that bad after all.

[Now my new goals!](/resume/2015-end)

## Skills
I am happy about Python & Node - especially coupled with Redis & MongoDB. Sad that I couldn't try out Sysadmin tools!

## Languages
I didn't practice Dutch as I wanted to :'( thankfully I am moving to Brussels so I will be living the language

## Certifications
OMG Linux certifications are hella expensive. Thought this was just for Cisco...
