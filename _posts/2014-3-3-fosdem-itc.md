Last month I attended FOSDEM. It was amazing. Overall my first experience in a conference/meeting of that kind, it boosted a lot my motivation for making (/contributing to) wonderful stuff with the computer. 

One such thing could be the Online Membership System, a project from AEGEE I've got to be involved into. Indeed I was lucky enough to extend my stay in Brussels for another week in order to join the ITC meeting that was taking place the weekend after FOSDEM. There I met all the good guys from the IT committee and could introduce myself. Just as I wanted to do last November. 

Awesome.
