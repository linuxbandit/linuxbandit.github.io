Thank you AEGEE ♥

Unlike last general assembly ("Agora") in Greece (last May), during this agora I did not have bronchitis. That's quite a huge pro, especially if you are the only one 
representing your body (the IT Committee).

Since I was the only one, of course, presenting the activity report of what we've been doing since Greece was up to me - the thing is that unlike the agora in Greece, this activity report was not in a small room where who was interested joined. This time it was on the stage, like, the big stage, where 900~ people would see me. Despite having delivered some workshops/seminars to an audience of 60-70 people, an order of magnitude more is not really comparable, yet I was chill and everything went smooth. As one of my Hellenic friends say, "quality". 

Oh, ironically there was a workshop on public speaking the third day of the agora --too bad I presented in the second day :v

But thank you AEGEE ♥ self-improvement is always welcome
