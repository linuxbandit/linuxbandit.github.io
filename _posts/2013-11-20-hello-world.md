Finally took some time off my other projects to have a decent website I can use to introduce myself.
The previous one was made with the auto-page generator of [GitHub](http://pages.github.com).
Now I use Jekyll - I forked this [cool template](https://github.com/swanson/lagom) (thanks to the [creator](http://mdswanson.com)).
