![POWER](/img/powermember.png "POWER!")

I have been invited as a teacher for the [ITES](http://www.wg.aegee.org/itwg/ites2014/). There's only one word appropriate for the situation: POWER! 

I hope this experience can help me find my way. Would I like to be a mentor? I've always liked to teach people stuff, and the occasions in which I did tutor people they've always achieved satisfactory results. So far I've studied, worked for a big firm, worked for a small firm, but never taught to people (besides my short tutoring periods - note to self: if you teach too good, they won't need you anymore). 

This can give me experience and insight on this field too.
