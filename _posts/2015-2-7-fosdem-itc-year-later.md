After my post of [last year](/blog/2014/03/03/fosdem-itc.html), life has turned out good after all! I now live in the headquarters of AEGEE where I can work full time to improve their IT infrastructure.

Smooth: I've set a goal, I've reached it (almost: I still haven't contributed to existing open source projects, I only started my own ones).

Also since I live here, I attended FOSDEM again. It wasn't as cool as last year, yet it was inspiring and most important, motivating (again).

Anyhow, this is probably my last post where I talk about life stuff. From now on Iâ€™ll (try to) post meaningful stuff like troubleshoots or tutorials (of nice things; not just any MySQL tutorial #23924823048239, but for instance an ElasticSearch one since it's in my [target resume](/resume/2015-end) and not many troubleshoot articles are available)
