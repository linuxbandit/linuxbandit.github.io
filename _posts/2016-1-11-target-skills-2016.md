Another review for me, actually pretty similar to last year's one! [Here's](/resume/2016-beg) a current version of my skill set as of Jan 2016, and it can be compared to the [goals I had set](/resume/2015-end). I feel like less has been achieved, probably it is also due to my trip to South-East Asia, Ukraine, Russia, and Mongolia.. Which took time, and definitely was worth it. Amazing experience.

[Now my new goals!](/resume/2016-end)

## Skills
I have improved heavily my knowledge of Node and Javascript, since it's what I am using the most in the [project I am leading](http://www.github.com/AEGEE/oms-core). I have still not learnt Backbone but I have Express on the back-end (which I prefer over the front-end).
I decided to give one last chance to (myself trying) Rails, if this year doesn't work out then I'll give up.
I could have hands-on experience with Puppet, finally, thanks to the Vagrant environment we've set up for the project!

## Languages
I didn't practice any language, but I have learnt many words or expressions from my trips. I am VERY satisfied.

## Certifications
Certifications are still expensive and I am still volunteering, so this will wait for a couple of years!
I also withdrew from the Sailing licences so all I have is the radio operator certificate.
