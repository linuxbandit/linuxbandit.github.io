Took me a while to realise it, but around 2 weeks ago the project I was working on with my pals from the 0p3n_L4b became a test project of our newly-created company.

We've gathered investors and funds and done all the stuff that people do when, well, effectively making a startup. I guess I can say I am working in a startup now? That's cool and new to me. Excitement!

Finally something concrete is happening. We've been talking about it since January (maybe a lil' bit around end of December too), I've done stuff for this project without any idea of the final form all through Jan/Feb/Mar, and finally at the end of March something was born. 

And I'll have the role of project manager.
